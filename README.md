## :wolf: <span id="down with the house">Down With The House</span>
Down With The House is a thrilling 2D RPG that reimagines the classic tale of The Three Little Pigs. In this twisted version, the pigs are not the innocent characters you remember. Instead, they are ruthless antagonists who have used bombs to destroy the wolf's family. Now, it's time for the wolf to seek revenge.
## :bomb: <span id="description">Description</span>
In Wolf Game, you play as the wolf, seeking vengeance against the evil pigs. The game features:

- **Objective:** Blow down all the pigs' houses to avenge your family. Be careful to avoid the bombs they throw at you.
- **Gameplay:** Navigate through different levels where each level represents a pig's house. Your goal is to destroy each house while dodging bombs thrown by the pigs.
- **Controls:** Use the arrow keys to move the wolf to dodge the bombs.
- **Levels:** Three progressively harder levels, each with unique challenges and increasing difficulty.
- **Health System:** Manage your health carefully. Taking too many hits from bombs will end the game.
